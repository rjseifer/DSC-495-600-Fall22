    "A nice improvement on Word2Vec was made by Facebook researchers (including Mikolov) called, fasttext, https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea to the improvement was to replace words and phrases as the base unit input layer with partial character -grams of words. For example instead of \"apples\" they used things like \"app\", \"ppl\", \"ple\", and \"les\".\n",

    "Below I'll demonstrate Facebook's pretrained model trained on Wikipedia. Note don't try and run this code right now because it takes a long time to download the model. Just watch the code, and if you're interested in the model you can always play with it later."
